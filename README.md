# UFO Sightings Around the World

During this week project, we have been working on developing an **Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs)** sightings webpage.  The website shows a table listening several sighting events registered around the world. The table is dynamic such that the user is able to filter table output based on the date in which the sighting ocurred.

## Overview of the Project:

Now, we want to update our website adding multiple filters that allow the user to display in the table only the sightings that meet the specific search citeria. The filtering criteria consider: *Date, City, State, Country* and *Shape*.
